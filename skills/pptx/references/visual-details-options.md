# Visual Details Options

Design options to spark creativity when creating presentations.

## Geometric Patterns
- Diagonal section dividers instead of horizontal
- Asymmetric column widths (30/70, 40/60, 25/75)
- Rotated text headers at 90° or 270°
- Circular/hexagonal frames for images
- Triangular accent shapes in corners
- Overlapping shapes for depth

## Border & Frame Treatments
- Thick single-color borders (10-20pt) on one side only
- Double-line borders with contrasting colors
- Corner brackets instead of full frames
- L-shaped borders (top+left or bottom+right)
- Underline accents beneath headers (3-5pt thick)

## Typography Treatments
- Extreme size contrast (72pt headlines vs 11pt body)
- All-caps headers with wide letter spacing
- Numbered sections in oversized display type
- Monospace (Courier New) for data/stats/technical content
- Condensed fonts (Arial Narrow) for dense information
- Outlined text for emphasis

## Chart & Data Styling
- Monochrome charts with single accent color for key data
- Horizontal bar charts instead of vertical
- Dot plots instead of bar charts
- Minimal gridlines or none at all
- Data labels directly on elements (no legends)
- Oversized numbers for key metrics

## Layout Innovations
- Full-bleed images with text overlays
- Sidebar column (20-30% width) for navigation/context
- Modular grid systems (3×3, 4×4 blocks)
- Z-pattern or F-pattern content flow
- Floating text boxes over colored shapes
- Magazine-style multi-column layouts

## Background Treatments
- Solid color blocks occupying 40-60% of slide
- Gradient fills (vertical or diagonal only)
- Split backgrounds (two colors, diagonal or vertical)
- Edge-to-edge color bands
- Negative space as a design element
